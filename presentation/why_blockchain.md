### **Why Use Blockchain for Public Research Papers?**  

Even though research papers are meant to be public, blockchain adds several key advantages:  

1. **Immutable & Censorship-Resistant Storage** 🛡️  
   - Traditional research databases (e.g., Google Scholar, ResearchGate) can **remove or restrict** papers.  
   - With **IPFS/Arweave + Ethereum**, once a paper is published, **no one can alter or delete it**.  

2. **Proof of Authorship & Timestamping** ⏳  
   - Smart contracts **timestamp** each research paper, proving **who published first**.  
   - Prevents **plagiarism** and ensures proper **credit to original authors**.  

3. **Decentralized Peer Review System** 🌍  
   - Traditional peer review is **slow, expensive, and biased**.  
   - Our system **incentivizes** peer reviewers with **token rewards**, ensuring **fair and efficient** reviews.  

4. **Global Accessibility Without Paywalls** 🌎  
   - Many journals hide research behind **paywalls** (Elsevier, Springer).  
   - Blockchain-based publishing ensures **open access** **without middlemen**.  

5. **Crowdfunded Research & Rewards for Authors** 💰  
   - Researchers can **raise funds** directly from the public via **DAO-based grants**.  
   - Authors can **earn tokens** based on the impact of their research (e.g., citations, views).  

6. **Verifiable & Transparent Citations** 📖  
   - Every citation is **tracked on-chain**, ensuring proper **attribution to original work**.  
   - Prevents **citation fraud & manipulation** in academic publishing.  

### **Conclusion**  
Even though research is **public**, blockchain ensures **permanence, transparency, and fairness**, removing **publishers' monopoly** and giving control **back to researchers**. 🚀
